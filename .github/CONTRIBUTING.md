## New Contributor Tutorial

For new contributors, we've put together a detailed tutorial
[here](https://github.com/nttcom/eclcloud/tree/master/docs/contributor-tutorial)!

## 3 ways to get involved

There are three main ways you can get involved in our open-source project, and
each is described briefly below.

### 1. Fixing bugs

If you want to start fixing open bugs, we'd really appreciate that! Bug fixing
is central to any project. The best way to get started is by heading to our
[bug tracker](https://github.com/nttcom/eclcloud/issues) and finding open
bugs that you think nobody is working on. It might be useful to comment on the
thread to see the current state of the issue and if anybody has made any
breakthroughs on it so far.

### 2. Improving documentation

Eclcloud's documentation is automatically generated from the source code
and can be read online at [godoc.org](https://godoc.org/github.com/nttcom/eclcloud).

If you feel that a certain section could be improved - whether it's to clarify
ambiguity, correct a technical mistake, or to fix a grammatical error - please
feel entitled to do so! We welcome doc pull requests with the same childlike
enthusiasm as any other contribution!

### 3. Working on a new feature

If you've found something we've left out, we'd love for you to add it! Please
first open an issue to indicate your interest to a core contributor - this
enables quick/early feedback and can help steer you in the right direction by
avoiding known issues. It might also help you avoid losing time implementing
something that might not ever work or is outside the scope of the project.

While you're implementing the feature, one tip is to prefix your Pull Request
title with `[wip]` - then people know it's a work in progress. Once the PR is
ready for review, you can remove the `[wip]` tag and request a review.

Please do not hesitate to ask questions or request clarification. Your
contribution is very much appreciated and we are happy to work with you to get
it merged.

## Getting Started

As a contributor you will need to setup your workspace in a slightly different
way than just downloading it. Here are the basic instructions:

1. Configure your `$GOPATH` and run `go get` as described in the main
[README](/README.md#how-to-install).

   ```bash
   go get github.com/nttcom/eclcloud/v3
   ```

2. Move into the directory that houses your local repository:

   ```bash
   cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/nttcom/eclcloud/v3
   ```

3. Fork the `nttcom/eclcloud` repository and update your remote refs. You
will need to rename the `origin` remote branch to `upstream`, and add your
fork as `origin` instead:

   ```bash
   git remote rename origin upstream
   git remote add origin git@github.com:<my_username>/eclcloud.git
   ```

4. Checkout the latest development branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   ```

5. If you're working on something (discussed more in detail below), you will
need to checkout a new feature branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-new-feature
   ```

6. Use a standard text editor or IDE of your choice to make your changes to the code or documentation. Once finished, commit them.

   ```bash
   git status
   git add path/to/changed/file.go
   git commit
   ```

7. Submit your branch as a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). When submitting a Pull Request, please follow our [Style Guide](https://github.com/nttcom/eclcloud/blob/master/docs/STYLEGUIDE.md).

> Further information about using Git can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

Happy Hacking!

## Tests

When working on a new or existing feature, testing will be the backbone of your
work since it helps uncover and prevent regressions in the codebase. 

This repository has unit tests described below.

> We plan to prepare acceptance test as further implementation.

### Unit tests

Unit tests are the fine-grained tests that establish and ensure the behavior
of individual units of functionality. We usually test on an
operation-by-operation basis (an operation typically being an API action) with
the use of mocking to set up explicit expectations. Each operation will set up
its HTTP response expectation, and then test how the system responds when fed
this controlled, pre-determined input.

To make life easier, we've introduced a bunch of test helpers to simplify the
process of testing expectations with assertions:

```go
import (
  "testing"

  "github.com/nttcom/eclcloud/v3/testhelper"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
  result, err := Operation()

  testhelper.AssertEquals(t, "foo", result.Bar)
  testhelper.AssertNoErr(t, err)
}

func TestSomethingElse(t *testing.T) {
  testhelper.CheckEquals(t, "expected", "actual")
}
```

`AssertEquals` and `AssertNoErr` will throw a fatal error if a value does not
match an expected value or if an error has been declared, respectively. You can
also use `CheckEquals` and `CheckNoErr` for the same purpose; the only difference
being that `t.Errorf` is raised rather than `t.Fatalf`.

Here is a truncated example of mocked HTTP responses:

```go
import (
	"testing"

	th "github.com/nttcom/eclcloud/v3/testhelper"
	fake "github.com/nttcom/eclcloud/v3/testhelper/client"
	"github.com/nttcom/eclcloud/v3/ecl/network/v2/networks"
)

func TestGet(t *testing.T) {
	// Setup the HTTP request multiplexer and server
	th.SetupHTTP()
	defer th.TeardownHTTP()

	th.Mux.HandleFunc("/networks/d32019d3-bc6e-4319-9c1d-6722fc136a22", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// Test we're using the correct HTTP method
		th.TestMethod(t, r, "GET")

		// Test we're setting the auth token
		th.TestHeader(t, r, "X-Auth-Token", fake.TokenID)

		// Set the appropriate headers for our mocked response
		w.Header().Add("Content-Type", "application/json")
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)

		// Set the HTTP body
		fmt.Fprintf(w, `
{
  "network": {
	  "admin_state_up": true,
	  "description": "",
	  "id": "d32019d3-bc6e-4319-9c1d-6722fc136a22",
	  "name": "network-1",
	  "plane": "data",
	  "shared": false,
	  "status": "ACTIVE",
	  "subnets": [
      "f634c653-0e4e-45ed-98c4-b231512ea839"
    ],
	  "tags": {},
    "tenant_id": "9ee80f2a926c49f88f166af47df4e9f5"
   }
}
			`)
	})

	// Call our API operation
	network, err := networks.Get(fake.ServiceClient(), "d32019d3-bc6e-4319-9c1d-6722fc136a22").Extract()

	// Assert no errors and equality
	th.AssertNoErr(t, err)
	th.AssertEquals(t, n.Status, "ACTIVE")
}
```

### Running tests

To run all tests:

  ```bash
  go test -tags fixtures ./...
  ```

To run all tests with verbose output:

  ```bash
  go test -v -tags fixtures ./...
  ```

To run tests that match certain [build tags]():

  ```bash
  go test -tags "fixtures foo bar" ./...
  ```

To run tests for a particular sub-package:

  ```bash
  cd ./path/to/package && go test -tags fixtures ./...
  ```
